Durban — The case against a Malvern couple alleged to have sexually violated a 13-year-old was now trial ready. The 26-year-old man and 39-year-old woman, who were currently out on warning in the matter, appeared on Tuesday in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court. Last week, when the pair appeared in court, the case docket had not been sent from the Malvern Police Station to court. It was then adjourned for the docket as well as a decision from a regional court prosecutor on transfer from the district court to a trial court. In court, State Prosecutor Nomcebo Xulu said the case would continue in the regional court. The couple are alleged to have let the girl drink alcohol, smoke dagga, watch porn, exposed certain body parts to her, touched her private part, and had sex in front of her, allegedly inviting her to join them as well. According to the State, the child had come over to their home for a sleepover while her mother was away. The couple is friends with the child’s mother. The pair face charges of compelling or causing children to witness sexual offences, sexual acts, or self-masturbation and exposure or display of or causing exposure or display of genital or female breasts. Meanwhile, a 38-year-old father alleged to have raped his daughter,16, more than once, was expected to apply for bail on February 21 in the Pinetown court. The State indicated that it would be opposing bail on concern that the man would interfere with the complainant. The court has asked for an alternative address to be provided for the accused if he was granted bail.  Information that the Daily News has was that the teen was now pregnant. "The matter is on the roll for an alternative address to be verified. The investigating officer has spoken to the family, who said that after convening had decided that they are not willing to house the accused," said  Xulu.
