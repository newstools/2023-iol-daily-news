Durban — Following recent protests for better service delivery, Phoenix residents have combined forces and asked eThekwini Municipality to help clean up the area. Together with residents, Giving Hope Foundation (GHF) spokesperson Roy Sukdhev said that this followed up on last Sunday’s Candlelit Peace Protest. The aim was to clear up the burnt tyre debris that was caused due to previous protests in the area. Sukdhev said, “In the face of impossible odds, people who love this country can change it and that’s what we encourage our people to do. “We are not making Phoenix better merely for those who care, but also improve the lives of people who are struggling to make ends meet.” Sukdhev highlighted that the extended hours of power outages, and days of water cuts due to broken electric cables, and water pipes had cost the residents lots of money as their food became unsafe to eat, and those were mainly poor people. He said that leaders in Phoenix are liaising with the service delivery departments. On Thursday, Sukdhev said that they wrote a letter to the eThekwini Municipality asking for assistance to clear up all the debris. However, they received no assistance from the eThekwini Municipality, he said. In the letter, Sukdhev told the municipality about the GHF’s plan to clean up the Phoenix Highway Intersection. Sukdhev said, “A maximum of two bakkie loads of this burnt metal needs to be disposed of at Buffelsdraai Landfill.” He added that the Cleansing and Solid Waste service did later reply and gave them permission to proceed with the clean-up on Friday. “We did their job clearing the debris on their municipal property, and asked them to write a letter motivating for a waiver of disposal fee. To how much more ridiculous level can they stoop down to?” he asked. WhatsApp your views on this story to 071 485 7995. Daily News
