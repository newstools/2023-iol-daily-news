Durban — A cyclist that had fallen in Giba Gorge, west of Durban, was rescued in a two-hour operation by emergency services. In a video, an unnamed Mobi Claw 911 medic said that they received a Mobi Claw panic from one of their clients who fell in the Giba Gorge area, quite deep into the bush. The medic said they activated their medical role-players and service providers which include ER24, Netcare 911 and Emer-G-Med paramedics. “The guy was quite deep down in the valley which resulted in a two-and-a-half rescue that took place,” the medic said. “Paramedics had to go on foot into the bush to get to the patient. “The patient was in a reasonably good condition. We stabilised him on the scene and eventually got him back into the vehicle because we got him out of the bush and into an ambulance and straight through to Hillcrest Private Hospital,” the medic said. Emer-G-Med paramedics spokesperson Kyle van Reenen added that just after 9am on Friday, Emer-G-Med paramedics responded to an alert for a cyclist who had fallen in the Giba Gorge area. The teams established that the cyclist was within the gorge trails and had sustained serious injuries. “A GPS location of the patient was sent and an elderly male was located by paramedics who stabilised him on the scene before he was loaded into a 4x4 vehicle and driven to an awaiting ambulance, under the care of an emergency care practitioner and transported through to the hospital for further care,” Van Reenen said.
