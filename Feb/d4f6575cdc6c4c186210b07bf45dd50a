Durban – eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has congratulated NFP councillor Zandile Myeni for her appointment as the deputy mayor of the city. Myeni was elected to the post during a special council meeting on Friday. The other candidate put forward for the post was the IFP’s Mdu Nkosi but Myeni emerged victorious with 128 votes. She replaces Abantu Batho Congress president Philani Mavundla, who was ousted from the position late last year, amid a public fallout with Kaunda. Myeni is a deputy mayor on the ticket of smaller parties in the council that are in a coalition with the ANC. Her appointment was also backed by the EFF.  In congratulating Myeni, Kaunda said he believed the two of them will have a good working relationship. “Let me start by congratulating the deputy mayor and wish her all the best in executing her responsibilities in the office. We have been together working on the ground and these two offices will be working as a united office,” he said.  In what could be seen as an apparent swipe at Mavundla, Kaunda said, “I think it’s going to help me that she is not going to be claiming to be a president of a particular party and take that presidency and put it in the deputy mayor’s office.  So I think we will have a smooth way of running this municipality with her.” He also congratulated ANC councillor Patience Sishange who was voted in as the new whip of council.  “I have been serving with her as my whip in the finance committee, I know her capacity and capability will be able to be equal to the task.” THE MERCURY
