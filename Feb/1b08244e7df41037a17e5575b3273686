Durban — The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has welcomed new MEC Super Zuma, in his new role to champion agriculture in the province. Zuma was appointed by KZN Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube on Tuesday and subsequently sworn in by the province’s new Judge President Thoba Poyo-Dlwathi. The acting head of department, Zibusiso Dlamini, on behalf of all staff and stakeholders, said Zuma would bring his vast experience to the department having served in various spheres of government. Moreover, before joining the department, Zuma has served as the chief whip of the ANC in the KZN legislature since 2019. He was the chairperson of Whips Forums where he served multiple portfolio committees including agriculture and the standing committee on oversights. Furthermore, Dlamini said as the department strives to attain an inclusive, sustainable and transformed agricultural sector, Zuma’s expertise would be vital. “We are delighted to have a leader of Zuma’s calibre to drive us to achieve our mission as set out in the National Development Plan. We are committed to working with and supporting him in a new capacity. “We are optimistic that his vast experience in community service will drive the department toward achieving its vision. As the head of administration, I would like to pledge our support and commitment to the MEC in his bid to make meaningful changes to the lives of the people of KZN,” he said. Dlamini added that through the National Development Plan, the department was mandated to grow the country’s agricultural production, which would lead to job creation and food security programmes being rolled out, “which we believe Zuma will assist in providing oversight as he has been doing from the legislature”.
