Durban — A Phoenix school, north of Durban, has been closed indefinitely after water pipes were stolen. Local WhatsApp groups in Phoenix reported that there was no water at Rustic Manor Primary School due to stolen pipes and possibly a “water meter” on the municipality’s side. In a WhatsApp message, the principal, S Yusuf, stated that the problem had been escalated to all role-players, the municipality and councillors, as well as the sector 5 Community Police Forum. Yusuf said he was not sure when it would be repaired. Phoenix Sector 5 CPF chairperson Claude Govender and the Department of Water and Sanitation visited the school and found that the meter was enacted and that the leak was from another pipe. He said it was an external pipe and not within their jurisdiction. “If it is not within their jurisdiction, then the school governing body has to hire a private plumber. If that is not possible, they can apply to the Department of Public Works,” he said. The KZN Department of Basic Education could not be reached for comment. The Phoenix SAPS had not received a report at the time of publishing, police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said. WhatsApp your views on this story to 071 485 7995. Daily News
