Durban — King Misuzulu has called on the regiments and the Zulu nation to protect its culture and heritage. The king was speaking at the official send-off ceremony of Amabutho in Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal, on Thursday before leaving for Dundee, where they will be taking part in the annual commemoration of the Battle of Isandlwana at the weekend. The king emphasised the importance of unity and co-operation among Zulus, saying in order to be able to preserve the nation’s culture and heritage unity was paramount. Referring to the latest bid to unseat him, the king said he was aware that the confusion was not yet over. Earlier in the day a monument was erected in honour of King Cetshwayo’s prime minister, Mnyamana Buthelezi, and Amabutho commander Ntshingwayo Khoza. Mnyamana, who was Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi’s grandfather, played a major role in coming up with strategies that helped King Cesthwayo defeat the British army, working together with Khoza as regiments commander. Commenting on the honouring of his grandfather, Buthelezi said what was important was to honour heroes of the Isandlwana battle. Buthelezi described Khoza and Mnyamana as heroes who, even after the British army had doubled the number of regiments, proceeded to a war and fought bravely to defend the Zulu kingdom against British colonial rule. The king is expected to lead Amabutho during the mock battle between Zulus and the British army at the foot of Isandlwana mountain, now a heritage site. The event is held annually to commemorate the victory of the Zulu regiments in January 1879. Daily News
