Durban — Two Eden College class of 2021 matriculants who passed with flying colours said they were doing exceptionally well at university although the transition from high school was not smooth. Shraya Archary, 18, is entering her second year of studying medicine at Stellenbosch University. Shraya said it was not easy for her as she had to move to another province. Balancing academic and campus life was not easy. However, she was learning to balance the two. “Being away from home was difficult. We would video call with my mom so that she can share some of the recipes I could use to make meals to remind me of home,” said Shraya. She realised that it was not worth stressing over getting an A+ because that put her under so much pressure. She had to tell herself she was doing her best. “University is different from high school because there is a lot of work that you have to go through. “Lecturers are not like teachers,” Shraya said. She said although she faced some challenges trying to transition from high school to university, she made it. Shraya added that making friends at university was not as easy. Jaedon Naidu, 18, who will starting his second year in his studies towards a BSc Data Science degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), said his first year had not been that different from high school, as their classes were online. “With data science it’s possible to just excel in it, like I was doing in high school,” said Naidu. He hailed his university lecturers and said they were helpful. Naidu added that his first year was intense. However, he did not regret the course he chose and he was happy Daily News
