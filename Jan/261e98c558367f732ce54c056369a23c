Durban — Parents nationwide were filled with joy and excitement as they witnessed their children walk into school for the first time and begin their educational journey. During the new Grade 1 intake at Glenwood Preparatory School, parent Chantelle Bodenstein said she had mixed feelings and emotions but was excited. Another parent Siobhan Rossouw was overwhelmed with joy as this was her first child to attend school. She and her son were geared up for the year ahead. “We started baby school and now we’re starting big school – day 1 of a 12-year sentence,” said Roussouw. Grade 1 teacher Lauren Powney said that it was a privilege to be a part of such a pivotal day. She said: “They all start off fresh, and have no idea what big school is all about. “We start shaping them from this moment. It is important to establish their relationship with the school, going forward. “They surprise you and seem far more adaptable than we think. At this point they are sponges and pick everything up. They are very technically wired.” School principal Noel Ingle said he was looking forward to the year as Covid-19 restrictions had decreased and the school could operate as normal. “It is a challenging year for the little people (Grade 1s) as it is something new and there are a lot of things they have to get accustomed to,” said Ingle. He added: “They’re very versatile and with proper, trained professional staff, it happens very quickly.” Ingle said that the Grade 1 group would experience making new friends and sitting still for long periods of time. “If we could all cast our minds back, some of our favourite memories include our Grade 1 teachers. Those little people are special and their teachers are special as well,” he said. Daily News
