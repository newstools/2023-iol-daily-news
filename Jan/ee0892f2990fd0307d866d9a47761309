Durban — Aspiring computer engineer and entrepreneur Ndumiso Zondi, 19, passed his matric with seven distinctions at Velabahleke High School in uMlazi in 2021, and is studying towards a computer engineering degree at UCT. Ndumiso said he followed a science stream because he was interested in becoming a computer scientist. He had always been interested in computers. “My family and teachers gave me enormous support and assistance. As a result, I found it a walk in the park to prepare for my exams. I would like to motivate learners to work hard to achieve their goals, follow their dreams and passion – which is why I’m donating R1000 to Velabahleke top achievers this year.” Ndumiso has also established a business – GoTutors – with three of his former schoolmates. He said the business helps learners who have no access to computers with their online applications for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, tertiary study applications, and assists others with their studies so they do well in matric. “Consistency, discipline and hard work are the top three ingredients to success,” said Ndumiso. Nhlanhla Gabayi, 19, said he passed his matric with eight distinctions. He is doing his BCom Financial Accounting, CA stream, at UCT and intends becoming a chartered account. Nhlanhla advised learners who are still at school to work hard, never give up and be consistent in their work, which will ensure their success. Sibusisiwe Sosibo, 18, excelled in her matric, obtaining distinctions in all her eight subjects. Sibusisiwe is studying actuarial sciences at Stellenbosch University – because of the passion she has for maths. She said: “It’s not easy to achieve this much, but working hard, and a never give-up mentality, is all it takes to reach your success.” Daily News
