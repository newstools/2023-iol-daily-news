Durban — The uMhlathuze municipality has discouraged the hosting of events at an abandoned quarry which residents have turned into a swimming pool in Richards Bay, northern KwaZulu-Natal. Pictures and videos of a picnic event held at the quarry began circulating on social media on Sunday. People were seen diving into the dam without any lifeguards on standby. The quarry made headlines following a tragedy that happened when Ndonda Manqele, 42, drowned in the area on January 19. His body was found by the City of uMhlathuze Fire and Rescue divers as well as the SAPS. Local authorities have repeatedly issued warnings regarding the dangers the quarry dam poses. According to municipal spokesperson, Bongani Gina, the dam was once a quarry mine abandoned by Ukumba Brick and Quarry (Pty) Ltd, a private company which received mining rights from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE). The dam is not situated in the municipal area, but under the Khoza tribal authority, said Gina. “We have informed the Khoza authority and the police to take control of the area working together. Our councillors have been on a public campaign warning communities about risks of swimming in a quarry,” said Gina. “Therefore, the responsibility and accountability rests with them and their directors to ensure compliance with the legislation as well as the terms and conditions in respect of which their mining right was issued,” he said. The municipality will conduct biological water testing to determine if it is safe for swimming. The municipality further stated that chemical tests would determine the amounts of mineral and organic substances that affect water safety, and subsequently affect skin, eyes or general health of those swimming there.
