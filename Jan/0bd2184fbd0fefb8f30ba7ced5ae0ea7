Durban — The family of a 31-year-old man who was shot dead by unknown men said they were anxiously waiting for police information to understand what had transpired. Tyron Pillay was shot alongside one other person on Dr Yusuf Dadoo Street in Durban on Tuesday around 5pm. It is alleged that the two were seated in a vehicle outside a shop when they were approached by the two armed men in a grey Toyota Avanza with Durban registration plates. They shot Pillay and the other person dead at the scene. According to EmerG-Med Paramedics spokesperson Kyle van Reenen, paramedics arrived to find the pair with multiple gunshot wounds. He said they were lying on the pavement. Tyron’s uncle, Timmy Pillay, said he was on his way home from work when his wife informed him about the “Rest In Peace” messages of their son appearing in a local WhatsApp group. “When my wife called me, I was shocked. I had to jump off the taxi and get a drop-off to the scene. I just looked through the WhatsApp chat on the group while I was on my way to the scene,” said Pillay. He said when he arrived the police were already at the crime scene, and he was not allowed to go any closer. “To be honest, I do not know what happened and how it happened. We are just waiting for the police to tell us. Nobody saw anything besides a car that drove off fast right after the gunshots,” said Pillay. Responding to drug-related suspicions, Pillay said he would not know, and that Tyron was an “honest person living an honest life”. “Both his parents have passed on. He was a happy person owning a bakery and supporting the family. “Therefore, I do not know of any alleged drug involvement,” said Pillay. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said police were on the lookout for the shooters. He said the motive had not been established. Daily News
