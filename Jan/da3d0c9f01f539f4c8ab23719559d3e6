Durban — The death of Zibuyile Ngubeni, 26, who was allegedly beaten to death with a hammer on Tuesday, has sent shockwaves through the Bergville community in KwaZulu-Natal. A man known to Ngubeni is on the run from police. Her family in Emmaus in Mhlathizi village, said they were living in fear that he might return. The man was still threatening family members via phone calls. Ngubeni's brother Siyanda said they were devastated by this, the second such loss in the family. He said they were still processing the loss of his other sister who was shot and killed by her boyfriend in the family yard recently. On the day of her death, Siyanda had been busy with household chores and in contact with Ngubeni throughout the day. The last the family heard from her was when she called to give them a grocery list to purchase. Later that evening they were informed of her death. “We do not have the full story of what actually happened. We have no answers and no one to ask these questions as we last saw the police on the day of the incident. We are hurting,” said Siyanda. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said the Bergville police were searching for the suspect. A case of murder was opened. KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza, said it was truly unfortunate and disturbing that an atrocity occurred while the family was still recovering from a similar incident. “The failure to arrest the assassin in the first incident still left many questions for the family. As a society, we need to ask ourselves if this is the life we want to live, where criminals get away with murder. We call on the community to work with the law enforcement authorities to ensure the suspect’s detention,” said Khoza. Daily News
