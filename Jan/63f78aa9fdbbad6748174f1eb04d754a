Durban — Police are still searching for the killers of a private security company owner based in Hammarsdale who was shot dead outside his home on Monday. Former police officer and founder of Qaphela Security, Ndumiso Manqele, 37, was a dedicated and loyal crime fighter who served his country and community over the years, said Steven King, spokesperson for the South Africa Community Crime Watch (SACCW). Manqele served in the SAPS between 2009 and 2018. KwaZulu-Natal SAPS spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda said Manqele was shot by unknown suspects at Zibuse village in Hammarsdale. The motive is yet to be established and investigations are unfolding. King said that Manqele established his own security company in 2014, and was very passionate about the company and made a huge impact in the communities he served. The SACCW thanked Manqele for his service and hoped that justice would be swift on those responsible for his death. Manqele had worked as a communications officer for four years with the Hillcrest SAPS and was ranked as a constable. He worked in different units in the police. On the Qaphela Security Facebook page Manqele stated: “While I was in the police, I noticed that the security is in demand due to the fact that police have limited resources. My intention is to make sure that our clients and our community are safe at all times because anyone can be the victim of crime.” Daily News
